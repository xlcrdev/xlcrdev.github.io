# About

Welcome. Let's see if this works eh?

I set this page up ages ago randomly and left it to wither here in a dark corner of the "G Hub" as I like to call it.

I set off now on another journey with Jekyll!

The intention here is to experiment with a new thing and put some of the coding nerd in me out here in the wild.

I'm looking for work as one of the following:

* Web Developer 
* WordPress Developer 
* PHP Developer 
* Laravel Developer 
* Full Stack PHP Developer

Some Details
* Lean towards backend development (PHP | Laravel) but skilled in front end design and development (Bootstrap & TailwindCSS) too. 
* Prefer working with WordPress / WooCommerce, have worked with Shopify and most other CMS / Ecommerce platforms. 
* Have worked at agencies and with agencies. 
* Can work independently or on a team. 
* Only interested in 100% Remote work 
* Very special Hybrid scenarios considered in DMV. 
* Totally cool with yearly or bi-annual meet ups, maybe even quarterly if it's in a cool location!
