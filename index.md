# Hello World

What is this? This is a Super Terrific GitHub Pages page!

Find out [what's this about](/about.md) in detail? I guess this is basically this is my "MySpace" of coding? So I figured I'd get some content up here and play around with this Jekyll stuff for a bit.

Check out the sidebar over there to the right! When you commit to main a little script in the template pulls the title and link to any file with the proper naming convention and extention in the _links folder. **Now that's Neat**
